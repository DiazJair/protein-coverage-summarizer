Protein Coverage Summarizer

This program can be used to determine the percent of the residues in each 
protein sequence that have been identified.  The program requires two input 
files: the first should contain the protein names and protein sequences 
(optionally with protein description) while the second should contain the 
peptide sequences and optionally also contain the protein name associated 
with each peptide sequence.  A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided 
to allow the user to select the input files, set the options, and browse 
the coverage results.  The results browser displays the protein sequences, 
highlighting the residues that were present in the peptide input file, and 
providing sequence coverage stats for each protein.

Double click the ProteinCoverageSummarizer_Installer.msi file to install.  The program
shortcut can be found at Start Menu -> Programs -> PAST Toolkit -> Protein Coverage Summarizer
